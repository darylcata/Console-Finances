# Title

In this activity, we tackle the application of for loops and other functions in Javascript. The website will show the Financial Analysis of any given months under the console.

## Description

 As this is our first Javascript homework, it was quite challenging and needs a lot of research and trial and error. For me, the coding looks neat along with some pseudo coding and description to guide me how the code should work

## Usage

This code can be used to calculate total earnings, the number of values you have entered, know its average and you can also check the highest and lowest profit and what month it was.
